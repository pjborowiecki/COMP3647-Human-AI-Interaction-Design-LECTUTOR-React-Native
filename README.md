## Description
LecTutor is a revolutionary application that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the effectiveness of students' study time. The app automates the process of question creation based on lecture notes or slides, enabling users to study more efficiently.

## Features
- **Question and Answer Generation:** Using AI, the app creates a set of questions and answers based on the content of lecture slides or notes provided by the user. The app gives the user control to review and adjust these questions and answers to fit their study needs.
- **Review and Rating System:** Users can rate the generated quizzes and review them later. The ratings are used to improve the quality of future quizzes.
- **Studying Reminders:** The app sends reminders and incentives like a "daily streak" to help users keep consistent with their studying.
- **Data Privacy:** All user data is stored locally on the user's device, ensuring utmost privacy and security.

## Disclaimer
Please note that as of now, the AI component of LecTutor is under development and has not been integrated with the application yet. The current version only includes the frontend development done in React Native.

## Installation
**Prerequisites:**
Ensure you have the following installed on your local development machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

**Installation Process:**
\```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/LecTutor.git

# Move to the LecTutor directory
cd LecTutor

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
expo start
\```
The Expo development tool will start in your default web browser and a QR code will be displayed in the terminal. You can then use the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to scan the QR code and run the application. 

## Usage
After installation and setup, the user can upload their study materials (notes or slides) in PDF or PowerPoint format to the application. The app generates a set of question and answer pairs based on these notes, which the user can then review and adjust as needed.

## Data Protection
LecTutor is designed with a focus on data protection and user privacy. All user data, including the uploaded study materials and generated questions and answers, is stored locally on the user's device. The data is not stored in a cloud database and cannot be accessed from outside the user's device.

## Feedback and Control
The app collects data from question ratings and alterations from users. This data is fed back into the AI to improve it once the AI feature is integrated. There is also an option to give explicit feedback, which will be used by the developers to see where the application can be improved and what functionalities could be added.
